# DATA SCIENCE: TEAM 13
# 26TH FEBRUARY, 2024


OVERVIEW

This project aims to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing car sales data. The dataset includes information on various attributes such as sales volume, price, horsepower, engine size, and others. The primary objectives of the analysis are to uncover insights, trends, and patterns within the dataset, as well as to address specific questions related to the automotive industry.

DATASET

The dataset used for this analysis contains the following columns:
Manufacturer: The manufacturer of the car.
Car_Model: The model of the car.
Sales_in_thousands: Sales volume of the car in thousands.
Price_in_thousands: Price of the car in thousands of dollars.
Fuel_efficiency: Fuel efficiency of the car in miles per gallon (MPG).
Horsepower: Horsepower of the car.
Engine_size: Engine size of the car in liters.
Year_resale_value: Resale value of the car after a certain number of years.


TASKS

The analysis includes the following tasks:

Data Preprocessing:
1. Checking the dimensions of the dataset.
2. Handling missing values and data types.
3. Removing duplicates.
4. Renaming columns.
5. Descriptive Statistics: Computing mean, median, and standard deviation of numerical columns.

Specific Analysis:

6. Identifying manufacturers with the highest and lowest average sales volume.
7. Examining the distribution of car prices.
8. Investigating correlations between numerical variables.
9. Visualizing the relationship between price and latest launch year.
10. Analyzing average price and fuel efficiency by manufacturer.
11. Identifying the most popular car brands.
12. Finding the car model with the highest resale value compared to its initial price.
13. Determining the top 3 fuel-efficient cars with engine sizes above 2.5 liters.
14. Identifying the Lexus model with the highest horsepower.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

a. Python

b. pandas

c. NumPy

d. Seaborn

RESULTS

The analysis revealed several insights and findings regarding car sales trends, pricing dynamics, fuel efficiency, and manufacturer performance. Visualizations and statistical summaries provided a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, aiding decision-making in the automotive industry.

A few insights:

1. We see that the 'PORSHE' sells with the highest price (In thousands) and the Lowest average sales volume. This makes sense because the more expensive the car, the fewer its buyers.
2. The most popular car brand is the FORD brand
3. The brand with the highest Average Sales Volume is the FORD
4. The Car Model with the Highest Resale Value is the 'FOCUS' made by FORD MANUFACTURERS
5. The top 3 fuel-efficient cars with engine size above 2.5 litres is the:
Impala
Monte Carlo
CLK Coupe
6. The Lexus model with the highest horsepower is the GS400
7. Cars prduced by SATURN car manufacturers has the best Average Fuel Efficiency
